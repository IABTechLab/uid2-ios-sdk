# UID2Prebid for UDI2 iOS SDK

This project exists because the Prebid mobile SDK for iOS, a dependency for UID2Prebid, does not support Swift Package Manager. It configures the UID2Prebid framework for testing, and houses sources for CocoaPods. If/when Prebid supports SPM, this project will not be necessary.

To bootstrap this project you will need to:

```sh
cd UID2Prebid
./bootstrap.sh
```

To develop & test UID2Prebid, open `UID2Prebid.xcodeproj`.
